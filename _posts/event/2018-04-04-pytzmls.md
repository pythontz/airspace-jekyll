This two days workshop is an introduction to Python for data science. Participants will learn the basics of Python and how to use it to develop website, perform scientific computing,  analyze data, create beautiful visualizations, perform web scraping and use powerful machine learning algorithms.

The workshop will cover:

1. A Thorough Introduction to Python Programming.
2. Python Web Development Using Flask.
3. Introduction to Scientific Computing with NumPy.
4. Data Analysis and Data Visulisation with Python.
5. Introduction to Machine Learning with Python.
6. Web Scraping & Crawling with Python.
